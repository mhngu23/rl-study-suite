# üéì rl-study-suite

A personal collection of foundational reinforcement learning algorithms, implemented from scratch for study and experimentation.  
This project is inspired by [Deepmind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ) and is structured for revisiting core RL concepts over a 3-month period with ~4 hours/week commitment.

---

## üìö Purpose

This repository serves as a lightweight codebase for revisiting RL concepts, understanding implementation details, and comparing algorithm performance in a clean, modular way.

## üß≠ Roadmap

Each week is based on a 4-hour time budget.

| Week | Topic                        | Goal |
|------|------------------------------|------|
| 1    | Setup + Rollouts             | Project structure, rollout collection |
| 2    | REINFORCE                    | Basic policy gradient with return-to-go |
| 3    | Baseline + Advantage         | Add value network for variance reduction |
| 4    | Logging + Comparison         | Visualize and compare learning stability |
| 5    | DQN                          | Value-based method with replay + target net |
| 6    | Double & Dueling DQN         | Improve stability and value estimation |
| 7    | Actor-Critic                 | Implement A2C with online value bootstrapping |
| 8    | Refactor + Summary           | Code cleanup, config support, benchmark PG vs DQN |
| 9    | DDPG                         | Off-policy continuous control with deterministic actor |
| 10   | TD3                          | Double critics and policy smoothing |
| 11   | PPO                          | Clipped surrogate loss, stable policy updates |
| 12   | Final Comparison             | Evaluate all methods and summarize findings |
